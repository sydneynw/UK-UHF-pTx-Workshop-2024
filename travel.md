The nearest subway stops are Kelvinhall and Hillhead, for traveling to the ARC from the City Centre. The social event on the evening of June 10th is being held at [Sloans](https://www.sloansglasgow.com/){:target="_blank"} in the City Centre.

# Travel to Glasgow
Where possible, we would encourage registrants to choose the most sustainable option available to them to travel to the workshop.
## By train
There are several direct trains daily from London Euston to Glasgow Central Station. For all UK rail travel bookings, we advise using a site like [The Trainline](https://www.thetrainline.com/){:target="_blank"}.
## By automobile
Glasgow is about 7 hours drive from London and is easiest reached from the M6 to the A74(M) coming from the south. The University of Glasgow ARC does not have dedicated parking and the closest parking in the West End is at the [Lilybank Gardens Car Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Wsxu57oRjYhqCAJp8){:target="_blank"} about 10 minutes walk away.
## By plane
Glasgow Airport is about 15 minutes drive from the City Centre or West End of Glasgow and can be reached by the [Airport Express Bus](https://www.glasgowairport.com/to-and-from/bus/){:target="_blank"} that runs from the Buchanan Bus Station or by Taxi/Uber. Edinburgh Airport typically has more international connections and is a [1 hour bus ride](https://www.edinburghairport.com/transport-links/buses-and-coaches/glasgow-bus-links){:target="_blank"}  to Glasgow Buchanan station in the City Centre.

# Accommodation in Glasgow
We have secured a small block of 20 single-occupancy rooms in [Cairncross House](https://www.gla.ac.uk/myglasgow/accommodation/visitorstouristsgroups/residences/cairncrosshouse/){:target="_blank"}, one of the University Residence Halls, which are an affordable option in Glasgow's West End within easy walking distance of the workshop venue. The rooms are available for 1-2 nights beginning on Monday, June 10th on a first-come, first-served basis and must be paid for at the time of booking. Residence halls can be  booked at the following link:

[UofG Residence Halls](https://book.accom.gla.ac.uk/KxBnBLive/Default.aspx){:target="_blank"} ; use promotion code: *ARC2024*

Unfortunately, the University Residence Halls only open for the season on Monday so are not available for those arriving on Sunday night. If workshop attendees would like to switch accommodations to the University Residence Halls after arrival, we have a small amount of space to stow luggage at the workshop venue (the ARC).  For other private accommodation recommendations, the local tourism agency People Make Glasgow [has an online guide](https://peoplemakeglasgow.com/good-to-know/hotels-and-accommodation){:target="_blank"}. As mentioned above, the ARC is in Glasgow's West End which has easy links to the City Centre.
