# UK-UHF-pTx-Workshop-2024

Building upon the momentum of the German Ultrahigh Field Imaging (GUFI) Network’s pTx Workshop hosted in Tübingen in 2023, this workshop will once again bring together experts on the topic of parallel transmission (pTx) to discuss latest advances in our field.

This workshop is being organized by a group of pTx users from the Universities of Glasgow (Dr Sydney Williams, Prof David Porter, Dr Kristin Flegal), Oxford (Dr Aaron Hess), and Cambridge (Prof Christopher Rodgers), on behalf of the UK 7T Network. It will be hosted at the [University of Glasgow Advanced Research Centre (ARC)](https://www.gla.ac.uk/research/arc/){:target="_blank"} on June 10-11, 2024. Registration will also be open to pTx researchers outside of the UK until workshop capacity (~100) is reached. 

The workshop schedule is currently being finalized, but will contain a mix of invited speaker, group discussions, and proferred talks from attendees. Three main themed sessions will take place on the second day:
1. pTx safety
2. RF pulse design and pTx sequences
3. 7T user needs for pTx

Please register for the workshop and find further information at the links below.
