# UK-UHF-pTx-Workshop-2024
Building upon the momentum of the German Ultrahigh Field Imaging (GUFI) Network’s pTx Workshop hosted in Tübingen in 2023[^1], this workshop will once again bring together experts on the topic of parallel transmission (pTx) to discuss latest advances in our field.

This workshop is being organized by a group of pTx users from the Universities of Glasgow, Oxford, and Cambridge, on behalf of the UK 7T Network. Registration will also be open to pTx researchers outside of the UK until workshop capacity (~100) is reached.
