# UK-UHF-pTx-Workshop-2024
Building upon the momentum of the German Ultrahigh Field Imaging (GUFI) Network’s pTx Workshop hosted in Tübingen in 2023[^1], this workshop will once again bring together experts on the topic of parallel transmission (pTx) to discuss latest advances in our field.

This workshop is being organized by a group of pTx users from the Universities of Glasgow, Oxford, and Cambridge, on behalf of the UK 7T Network. It will be hosted at the [University of Glasgow Advanced Research Centre (ARC)](https://www.gla.ac.uk/research/arc/) on June 10-11, 2024. Registration will also be open to pTx researchers outside of the UK until workshop capacity (~100) is reached. 

The workshop schedule is currently being finalized, but will contain a mix of invited speaker, group discussions, and proferred talks from attendees. Three main themed sessions will take place on the second day:
1. pTx safety
2. RF pulse design and pTx sequences
3. 7T user needs for pTx

Please register for the workshop and find further information at the links below.
